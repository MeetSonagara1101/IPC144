1). The use of the float data type, which has a limit amount of accuracy for representing decimal numbers, creates a problem with price1 and its converted cent value. As a result, price1's value of 17.96 has been calculated stored with a small rounding error. The rounding error increases when this approximation is multiplied by 100 and converted to an integer, generating a wrong cent value.

2). The first example divides the money value by 100.0, which is a decimal number. This division is done to convert the cents to dollars. The result is then printed as the dollar amount with two decimal places.

In the second example, the money value is divided by 100 after converting the number 100 to a decimal format. This conversion is done explicitly to ensure more accuracy in the result. The resulting value is then printed as the dollar amount with two decimal places.

The third example also converts the money value to a decimal format before dividing it by 100. This conversion is explicitly done to ensure greater accuracy in the result. The final value is then printed as the dollar amount with two decimal places.

3).a) The value of the variable result is 72. This is because when we divide the value of money (which is 7245) by 100, the result is an integer value. In this case, the decimal part of the division is ignored or truncated. So, the result becomes 72, which is assigned to the variable result.

  b) The values displayed for the four samples are as follows:

  Sample 1: $72.00
  Sample 2: $72
  Sample 3: $72.00
  Sample 4: $72
  c) The printf function uses format specifiers to determine how the provided values should be displayed in the output. In samples 1 and 3, there is a mismatch between the format specifier used and the type of the variable being printed.
