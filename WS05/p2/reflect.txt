1) Why do we try to use variables and macros to represent information rather than hardcode “magic” numbers (constant literals)? Using the details of this workshop, describe at least three advantages this provides us?

Answer: 
Whenever any programmer use meaningful variable in code it becomes very easy for other peoples to understand the the main purpose use of it. If need to change the value of any variable, So that i can change the value of it. this is one of my most used thing in every code by every programmer is using same variable again and again which can save lots of time and can cause less erros.
