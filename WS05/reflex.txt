2)The rating values entered by the user required iteration to perform basic validations with each iteration concentrated on testing for values to be within a specific range. Why do we not include additional logic that sums and performs the average? Instead, the sum and average logic is placed outside of any validation routine. Briefly explain two reasons why this is better design and refer to the details of this workshop to justify your answer.

Answer: The main reason of separating the validation from each other is that code becomes more easy to undersand and flexible. In the Whole code every block of code have different fuctionality. This habit of programmer gives surity that the input will be the same what you wise to have and the same here the sum and average calculation just need to do the mathematical operation and the separation help me to maintain my code well and the boost up the readability of the my code.
